# SitRight
SitRight is a web-based application that helps users quickly determine where on the train they should sit (far back, middle, or front) to most easily reach a specific exit at a subway station. The user specifies their starting station, the entrance/exit taken, and the destination station or address. The application then returns a recommendation on where in the train to sit, and also displays a map showing the exitsâ€™ locations.
